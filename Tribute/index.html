        <h3>Who Was Carl Jung?</h3>
        <p>
            Carl Jung believed in the “complex,” or emotionally charged associations. He collaborated with Sigmund Freud, but disagreed with him about the sexual basis of 
            neuroses. Jung founded analytical psychology, advancing the idea of introvert and extrovert personalities, archetypes and the power of the unconscious. Jung published numerous works during his lifetime, and his ideas have 
            had reverberations traveling beyond the field of psychiatry, extending into art, literature and religion as well.
